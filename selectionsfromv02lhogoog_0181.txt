Translation into Latin 151

or liccthocfactom; ‘I can d0 this,' hoc facere pomum,- ⁴ Ι ’
ought to do this,' hofacere debeo, or oportet m? hocfacere,·
‘I must do this,' m? hocsocere necesse est, neccsse est ut hoc
factem, or hoc mihi faciendum. In the past tenses the
auxiliaty becomes past, aud not the infinitive as in English:
e.g. licuit milri hocfocerc.

XXI. Some verbs are used with either the infinitive or
the subjunctive with a difference os meaning; the former
il the idea is really indirect discourse, the latter if it is
purpose: eg. ‘He persuades me that this is s0,’ mz'laei per·
suadet hoc ita esse,· ‘he persuades me to do this,’ mihi
persuadet ut hocsociam.

XXII. To write good Latin one must not only express
himself with grammatical correctness, but also idiomatically.
Many English expressions cannot be rendered literally; in
faena continuous passage of idiomatic English can hardly
ever be translated word for word into idiomatic Latin. Read
the passage carefully‚ and translate the thought, not the
words
