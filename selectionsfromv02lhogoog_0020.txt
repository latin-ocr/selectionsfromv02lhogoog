xii Hints on Method

they understand the meaning os what they have read. They
should acquire the habit of doing this without translating, even
in the mind. Reading the Latin, therefore, should not be an
occasional exercise, but a regular and important part of each
and every recitation, and os the pupil's preparation for recitation.
ln this connection, as well as an important aid in writing Latin,
the practice of committing to memory selected passages of Latin, .
and reciting them with correctness a'nd expression, is a most

and a real danger undoubtedly exists. li, however, the pupil be
trained from the outset to think in Latin, bad English need
never be used to explain the meaning of difficult sentences.

The ear should be trained as well as the eye. Thereiore the
pupil should occasionally be called on to translate, without the
text before him, passages read to him by his teacher. Oiten
pupils who hav'e acquired some facility in translating are unable
to comprehend simple sentences when read to them, or even to
write them in Latin from dictation

Pupils should acquire the ability to understand and trans·
late any Latin in which the words and the constructions are
familiar to them; that is to say, to translate at sight. To this
end they should master all new constructions and should learn
