1. THE BEGINNINGS OF ROME.

THE legends of the founding oi Rome and of the reigns of the seven
kings although believed in by the Romans themselves, and generally ae·
cepted in modern times until the publication of the first volume of Niebuhr's
Histooy ofRome, in 1811, cannot be accepted as history. They are largely
aetiological, that is, many of the stories have been invented to explain
customs and institutions which were already in existence at the beginning
of the historical period: and many of them may be traced to Greek
sources. The dates were traditioual with the Romans themselves, aud
are not to be relied dn. According to Lewis (On the Credibility of
Early Roman History), a trustworthy history of Rome does not begin until
the war with Pyrrhus. In this statement he undoubtedly goes too far ; but
the history of the period before the destruction of the city by the Gauls in
390 1³.c., while it narratas some historieal facts, cannot be accepted as
genuine in the form in which it has come down to ns.

For an excellent discussion of the historioal value of these legende see
ihne's Early Rome. '
