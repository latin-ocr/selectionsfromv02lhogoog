N this book the essential facts of Latin Grammar are pre·
sented within the smallest compass consistent with high
scholarly standards. lt covers not only the work of the pre-
paratory school, but also that of the required courses in college
and university. By omitting rare forms and syntectical usages
found only in ante-classical and port-classical latin, and by
relegating to an Appendix theoretical and historical questions,

” it has been found possible to treat the subject with entire ade·

quacy in the compass of ²50 pages exclusive of Indexes. In
the German schools, books ol this scope fully meet the exacting
demands of the entire gymnasial course, and those who have
tried Bennett's Grammar find that they are materially helped by
being relieved os the mass of useless aud irrelevant matter which
forms the bulk of the older grammars.

Professor william A. Hougltton, Bowdoin College, Brunswr'ck, Maiae:
The Grammar proper is admirably adapted to its purpose in its omnes
ol arrangement 3ηά classitication, 3ηά in its simplicity and precision of
statement, giving definitely just what the pupil must know, and not crowd·
ing the page witha mass ol matter that too olten disheartens the young
student instead of helping him. Ι trust-it will come into general use, ior
Ι think lor the reasons just given, and because ot its moderate compass
and attractive appearance, students are likely to get more practica] gram·
matical knowledge out oi it than they generally do lrom the larger
grammars.

Professor alfred Μ. Wilson, University os Nebraska, Lincoln: Ihave
examined it very carelully‚ and Ι can say, truly and with pleasure, that
my first impressions have become positive convictions as to the very great
value and utility of the book. Ι arn daily using it with increesing delight
·and'satisiaction. lt is clear, concise, and independent.

The critic, Feb. 29, 1896. The book is 3 marvel ol condensed, yet clear
and lorcible, statement. Just enough examplesaregiven to illustrateeach -
principle without discouraging the pupil by their number and variety.
The ground covered in the treatment oi forms and syntax is adequate

lor ordinary school work and lor the use oi freshmen and sophomores in
college.
