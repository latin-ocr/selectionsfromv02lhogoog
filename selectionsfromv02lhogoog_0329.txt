HE Orations given in this edition are the four against Cati·
line, those for the Manilian Law, Archias, Marcellus, and
the fourth oration against Antony. These are edited witha
view to showing their value as examples of oratory, rather than
as offering mere material for grammatical drill. The student's
attention is directed to the occasion and circumstances of their
delivery, as well as to the motive and method of presenting the
matter contained in them. Modes of legal procedure, the Con·
stitution and form of government in Cicero's time, and the whole
environment of the orator, are brought into clear view, and’made
a reality to the student.

The Letters are selected with reference to the light they shed
on Cicero as a man rather than as a politician. They afford
pleasant glimpses of his private life, and help to make real the
pupil's conception· of the times in which he lived. As material
for short exercises for sight translation or rapid reading they
will be found of special value.

A Table of ldioms and Phrases presents in form convenient
for use, constructions that deserve special attention.

lincoln Owen, Principal oftlte Rice Training-school, Borion: Kelsey's
Cioero isa model in the art of text-book making. lt cannot fail to be a
success for editor, publisher, and user. 1 count the teachers and the pupils
of the present generation fortunate in having such admirable ‘⁴ instrumente ·
of education ’' as Professor Kelsey is preparing for us.

Professor J. W. stema, University of Wtsconsin: Kelsey's Cioero com-
mends itself more than any words of mine can commend it. lt is ateach·
eris book, up to modern times, both in text and annotatione, and admirably
printed.

classes for five weelrs in connection with . . . in the hands of a part of
the class. Kelsey has the preference every time. It gives a body to the
ideas, and tells the scholare things that they want to lrnow in a way suited
to them. l have been waiting long enough to test it, and 1 lilre it better
