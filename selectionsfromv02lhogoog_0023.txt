Hints on Metlwd xv

stirring poem or an interesting historical novel will often make
an impression‚ when the formal work ol the class-roem has larled
to do so, and most young people are readily interested in reading
ol this kind.. Especially adapted to the purpose are Macaulay's
‘Lays of Ancient Rome' and parts of Byron's‘Childe Harold.'
For a selected list of historical novels see Kelsey's ‘F ifty Topies
in Roman Antiquities‚'¹ pp. 69, 70.
