T ranslation into Latin 149

definite than the English. Where in English we repeat a
proper name to avoid ambiguity, or use such paraphrases
as ‘the king’ ‘the CarthagInian,' etc, a carelully chosen
pronoun should be used in Latin.

VII. Be careful in the use of pronouns. On s? and suus
see B. 2443 A. 196 ; Η. 448 and 449. In your Latin read·
ing carefully observe the use of pronouns ’

VIII. Purpose may be expressed in various ways, but not
(in prose) by the infinitive.

IX. The voluntary agent is expressed by the ablative
with a preposition; the means or instrument, by the abla· ¹
tive wt'tlrouta preposition.

X. Be careful in translating English prepositions: eg.
‘He killed him wita a sword,' gladio eum interficia· ‘he
went with him‚’ cum εὖ {oin ‘when he heard os this,' cum

d? hoc uudlvisset‚· ‘a man of great eloquence,' vir magna ,

&loquentiu ,· ‘ the shepherd of the k1ng‚’past0rrrgms. Deter-
mine the exact force of the English preposition, and translate
accordingly.

XI. In translating Into Latin such sentences as ‘the man
I saw,’ the relative cannot be omitted. In cases where in
EngIIsh two nouus are connected by a preposition, unless
the relation can be expressed in Latin by the genitive, a
relative clause is generally necessary: eg. ‘sse embassy
from Pyrrhus,' either lyrrlri [agritia or legana quae ᾶ Pyrrho
mirso cst (or crat). Frequently an adjective may be used:
eg. ‘In the war with Jugurtha,’ beleb Iugurthino (see p. 54,
t 5, and the cross references).

XII. A personal or demonstrative pronoun at the begin-
ning of a sentence, and sometimes a noun (see VI), is often
best translated into Latin by a relative pronoun.
