V11. SERVIUS TULLIUS, THE SIXTH KING OF THE
ROMANS.

Pege 12. 1. Servius Tullius: according to the universal
tradition Servius was of Latin origin. The story of his career is
full of marvels‚ and cannot be regarded as history. The tradition
may point to a successful attempt ol the Latius to throw off the
yoke of the Etruscam, who, however, afterwards reconquered
them. The constitution ascribed to Servius goes back to very
early times3 it endured with some modifications until the fall of
the Republic.
