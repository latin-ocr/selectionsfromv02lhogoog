Caesar's Galllc War

Edited, with Introduction. Notes, Voczbnhry, Tabia of ldioms, and
twenty full-page illustratione, by Professor anwcrs W. Karssv, Uni-
versity of Michigan. ramo, half teacher, 506 pages. Price, §rap

HROUGHOUT the book every effort has been made, by
way of illustratiou and comment, to render the study of
Caesar attractive and useful, a means of culture as well as of dis·
cipline. That the result has been to produce the bestequipped
edition of the Gallie War is generally conceded.

The Introduction, besides givinga full review of Caesar's life
and character, furnishes also a concise and logical account of
the Roman art of war in Caesar's time. The illustrations con-
sist of six full-page colored plates‚ ofa double-page map of Gaul,
and of fourteen full-page maps and pians. ’

The text is clear, accurate, aud uniform in its orthography‚
and is conveniently divided by brief English summaries. Α

The Notes ar'e apt and sensible‚ with full references to the

Grammars of Bennett, Allen and Greenough, aud Harkness.
The Table of ldioms and Phrases‚ found in no other edition,
will enable a teacher to drill his class on those constructions
which are most perplexing to beginners.
The Vocabulary‚ like the Notes, is intended to give the pupil
only such help as he needs, and such knowledge as he cau digest.

charles S. Chelaita, principat Higlr Sckool, Fitchburg, Mass: I consider
Kelsey’s Cesar, both for teacher and pupil, the most admirable edition in
the field, combining in one volume text, notes, dictionary of antiquitis,
maps, and all the instruments for successful study of the Commentaries.

0. D. nonnam, Principal Hfgh school, Albany, Nat: lis a text-book it
seems to me lf not absolutely perfect, to approach as near perfectiori as
any book 1 have ever examined. The Introduction and colored platee
are invaluable as aids to a clear understanding of the text, and are su·
perior to anything of the kind elsewhere. The matrs, notes, vomituum,
and table of ldioms, are unsurpassed in any text-book of Caesar now iu use.

Richard M. Jones, Head Marter, Wm. Pcnn Charfcr 5⁶er Philadel-
plia: Kelsey²s Caesaris, in my judgment, the nearest approach yet made
in this country to what a school edition of an ancient classic should be.
