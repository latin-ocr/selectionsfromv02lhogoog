ΧΙ, PUBLIUS VALERIUS LAEVINUS AND PYRRHUS, KING
OF EPlRUS.

Pyrrhus: the Greek word from which the name Pyrrhus is
derived means ‘red' ‘dame-colored‚’ hence Macaulay calls him
‘the red king) With the story of Pyrrhus we reach the domain
of historical truth. He was one of the greatest generals of an-
tiquity, and one of the best kings. He was regarded by the

war with Pyrrhus as ‘a struggle fordominion with a noble and
powerful king,' and relates many anecdotes of his chivalrous
conduct.
