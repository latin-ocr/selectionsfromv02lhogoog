Translation into Latin 163

except¹ at a high price, he was condemned to death by
thern. But he fied to the Volscians, by whom „his valor was
highly esteemed ; for they made him their leader. Then
Coriolanus led the Volscians against Rome, and would have
taken the city, had not his mother and his wife persuaded
him by their prayers to lead the army away. Some² say
that he was put to death by the Volscians, others² that he -
lived among them ior many years. '

XI. PYRRHUS.

Pyrrhus, king os Epirus, who claimed-t0·be·descended³
from Achilles, was summoned⁴ into Italy by the people-
of-Tarentum, on whom the Romans had declared⁵ war.
Although he defeated the Romans in the first battle, yet he
lost the flower⁶ of his army, and said to his friends after the
battle that il he should gain⁷ another such battle he would-
have-toreturn⁸ to Epims alone. With Pyrrhus came Cineas,
a manos great eloquence‚ who tried to persuade the Romans
to make peace, but they replied that they would not make
peace until Pyrrhus departed⁷ from Italy.

Appius Claudius, though he was blind and old, had great
influence with⁹ the Romans. For when Cineas wished to
persuade them to make peace, aud the senate 'seemed to
incline towards making a treaty‚ Appius was carried ¹⁰ into
the senate house ¹¹ and persuaded ¹⁰ them to reply to Pyrrhus,
that he must⁸ leave Italy ii he wished' to have peace with
the Romans.
