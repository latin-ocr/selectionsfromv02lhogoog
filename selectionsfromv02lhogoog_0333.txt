RADATIM offers an excellent selection of easy reading-
matter which may be used to arouse and stimulate the
interest of'the pupil in his early study of Latin. lt may be used
either lor Iessons to be regularly prepared by classes just begin-
ning the subject, or lor sight-reading by more advanced stu-
dents¹. The abundance ol material offered will allow the teacher
to select such stories as will best serve his particular purpose.
The special excellence os Gradatim lies in the intrinsic interest
ol the stories. ln this respect it is equalled by no similar book
that has been ever issued.

Twentyfive pages ol Latin stories, which illustrate the use ol
the Accusative with the Infinitive, the Subjuuctive ol Indirect
Question, and the Ablative Absolute, have been added to the
original work. This is the· only edition ol the work in which
these three subjects are especially treated.

ln the first third os the book, all long vowels have been
marked; elsewhere they are marked only in words which are
likely to be mispronounced‚ or which occur for the first time.

The Vocabulary has been entirely rewritten, aud its scope
much enlarged. ’

Ray Gneus Hullng, Principal of tlu English High School, Cambridge,
Mass: ln its original English lorm it was a delightlul primer, and has
relieved the drudgery ol elementary work ln Latin ln many schools. The
changes introduced by this editor are genuine additions, making the work
a much better supplementary book lor early translation than before.

fl. S. cowell, Cushr'ng Acadcmy, Asamum, Mass„- l regard lt as a
very valuable book lor supplementary work lor first-year Latin students.

Professor John Η. drove, Ohio Wesleyan University: lt is certainly an

admirable book to put into the hands ol beginners ln Latin as a corn·

panion to the Latin Grammar. ln both matter and general appearance
the work will commend itsell to instructors.

B. L. D’Ooge, Narmal School‚ Ypsilantr} Mica: It ῖς in my judgment by lar
the best collection ol easy Latin Selections avallable.
