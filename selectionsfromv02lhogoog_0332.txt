Fir-st Latin Reader

κα

including Principles oi Syntax aud Exercisss ior Translation. By
Jansn W. Scunnsw, Latin Master ln the Albany Aoedmy. 16mo‚
eloth, ²95 pages. Prioe 90 oents.

HE first distinctive feature oi this book is, as its name sug-
gests, that the lessons contain connected Latin passages
for the pupil to read. As soon as practicable, the special gram-
matioel points to be learned in each lesson are illustrated, not in
disconnected sentences, but in a continuous latin story. The
stories are drawn cln'efly from Roman mythology and traditional
Roman history, interspersed with an occasional passage on the
lite of the Romans. This plan has the advantages oi acting as
apowerful incentive to worl:; oi adding directly to the pupil’s
knowledge oi Roman mythology, traditions, and customs3 and
of emphasizing at the outset the fact that grammaris merelya
means to the enjoyment of literature.

The second feature is that the exemisse ior· translating English
into Latin are based on the text immediately preceding them.

A third point oi special importance is that, beginning with
Lesson XX, apassage to be translated at sight is included in
every lesson. ln the report oi the Latin Conferenoe to the Com·
mittee on Secondary School Studies, this point is particularly
emphasized. Questions ior the pupil are inserted at the end of
each lesson. These are not intended ts taire the place of ques-
tions by the teacher, but are merely to enable the pupil to ascer-
tain whether he has thoroughly mastered his lesson. All the
necessary principles oi English Grammar are incorporated in
the body of the book. .

Lastly, questions in Latin referring to the text are included,
in the beliei that nothing lits the pupil more quickly to under-
stand Latin without translating, than this method oi asking and
answering questions in Latin. lt is expected that the use oi
this book will not only add to the beginner's enjoyment ot
Latin, but that it will insure rapid progress and unusual facility
in reading and understanding the language.
