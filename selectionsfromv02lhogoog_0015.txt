PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION.

IN the first four editions a number of errors, mainly typo·
graphical, have been silently corrected. ln the fifth, the Notes
have been considerably expanded, mainly in the line of empha-
sizing grammatica] constructions by cross references3 the Exer-
cises have been entirely rewritten and simplified, especially by
more frequent references to the pages and lines of the text.

The editor wishes to thank the teachers who have favored
him with suggestions. He is under special obligation to Pro-
fessor Isaac B. Burgess of the University of Chicago‚ Miss Mary
L. Miner of the Detroit High School‚ and Mr. E. L. Mason of
the Charlotte (Michigan) High School‚

September, 1895.

ln the sixth edition the ‘hidden quantities’ have been made
to conform with the lists in Bennett's Appendt'23 with which
the new edition of Lewis's Elementary Dicitorrary, 1895, is in

harmony in the great majority ol cases.
