and had-been-appointed-by-vvilll tutor to the king's children,

The two surviving² sons of Ancus were indignant that they
had been defrauded os their father’s8 throne. Accordingly⁴

While one os the shepherds was telling⁵ Tarquinius about
their pretended quarrel, the other raised⁶ his axe and
brought⁶ it down on the king’s head.

VII. SERVIUS TULLIUS.

1. Although Servius Tullius was the son osa slave, he
became king os the Romans after Tarquinius. 2. On ac· -
count of awonderful prodigy which happened, Tarquinius
was' persuaded to bring up Servius at his house as 11⁸ he
were his own child. 3. Let us seize the standard and send
it against the enemy. 4. If the Romans fight⁹ bravely in
order to recover the standard, they will carry off the victory.
5. When the shepherds had killed Tarquinius, Tanaquil con-
cealed his death. 6. ‘Do not think,'1⁰ said Π she, ‘that the

the three mountains to the city. 9. Do not join ¹⁰ the high·
spirited daughter of Servius to the violent son of Tarquin-
ius, lest they kill the king. ro. If the son of Tarquinius
had not been urged οιι12 by Tullia, he would not have recov-
