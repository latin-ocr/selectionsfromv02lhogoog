When the Carthaginians had taken war, Hannibal who
(when) a boy had sworn etemal hatred against the Romans,
crossed the Alps with a great army. Coming² into Italy,
he defeated the Romans with great slaughter at the Trebia
Ι river and at Lake Trasumenus. Then Quintus Fabius was
made dictator. He changed the plan os campaign,³ for he
did not join battle with Hannibal, but tried to wear out⁴ the
Carthaginian⁵ by delay. Once he nearly destroyed Hanni-
bal’s⁶ whole army, which he had shut in a narrow pass,
Minucius, the master os horse, to whom Fabius’s delay
was not agreeable, accused him οἰθ prolonging the war, and

induced the people to make his rank equal⁷ to that of ’

Fabius. When this had been done, Minucius joined battle
rashly with Hannibal, and would have been conquered had
not Fabius come to his rescue.⁸

After this about a dozen ⁹ young nobles of Tarentum made
aconspiraey, in order that Hannibal might get possession
of the city. They used to go out of the city under the
pretence¹⁰ of hunting, and when this had become such a
¹regular custom¹1 that the gate of the city was opened at
whatever time os night¹² they gave a signal by whistling‚
they admitted Hannibal with ten thousand soldiers. But
Fabius retoolr the city with equal ¹³ skill.
