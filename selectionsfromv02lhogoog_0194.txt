164 Exercises for

Pyrrhus seems to have been of a merciful disposition 1;
for although the people of Tarentum said that they had
spoken disrespectfully² of ³ the king when they were heated
with⁸ wine, he did not condemn them, because he thought
it was the fault of the wine rather than of the men.

XII. FABRICIUS.

Gaius Fabricius was a good man and distinguished in war,
but very poor. It is said that Pyrrhus could neither bribe
him with gold nor terrify him; and that although the king

secretly offered him the fourth partos his kingdom, is he
would consent⁴ to live with him, Fabricius⁵ could not be
persuaded to desert the Roman cause. But on the other
hand Pyrrhus’s physician could not induce Fabricius to
promise him a reward in case he should kill⁶ the king!

When Fabricius heard that there wasa man³ at Athens
who said that everything which was done ought to be referred
to pleasure, he is said to have wished that his enemies⁶ might
be persuaded of that, in order that they might be the more
easily conquered.

Although Fabricius despised⁹ money himself and could
not be turned from (the path of) integrity ¹⁰ by the offer¹¹ of
gold, yet when a dangerous war was-imminent‚¹² he advo-
cated ¹³ the election of Rufinus, an avaricious man, as con-
sul, because (as he said) 1⁴ he preferred to be robbed rather
than to be sold.
