Pion 28] Fabius Maximus 127

Romans ever experienced. Livy relates a story to the effect that
the iury of the combatants was such that they were uneonscious
of a destructive earthquake shock which occurred during the
battle. See Bymn, Chztde Hamil, ιν, 73:

'⁴ And such the shock oi battle on this day,
And such the irenzy, whose convulsion blinds

To all save earnage, that, beneath me fray,
An earthqualce rolled unheedingly away.''

2⁵. dictator: an extraordinary magistrate appointed in time
of peril. He held his office for six months only, and was
preceded by twenty-four lictors with the fasces and axes. He
had associated with him a lieutenant called the Master oi
Horse (magister equitum), whom he usually appointed himself.
As he had no colleague, and was irresponsible, his power was
greater than that of the consul. impetum mori tregit: i.e.
he checked Hannibal's victorious mreer by a policy oi delay..
, His design was to harass Hannibal and tire him out, without
risking a decisive battle. From the successful outcome oi these
tactics ‘F abian policy ³ has become proverbial.
