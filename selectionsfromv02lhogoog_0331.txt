S in the editions· of Caesar and Cicero by the same editor,
no pains have been spared to make the book pleasing to
the eye and useful to the student. The selectione, with a few
exceptionS‚ are short and complete in themselves· A consider-
able number of them will be found suitable for sight-reading.
The Introduction contains a sketch of the life and works of
Ovid‚ with a short essay on Ovid as a poet, together with an
outline of Greek and Roman Mythology.
The Notes are elementary, ,but at the same time they aim to
suggest a poetic interpretation of the author.

william C. collar, Headmaster, Roxbury Latin School, Mass: l am glad to
see an edition containing so good and so varied a collection from Ovid's
writings. The book seems to me to he a very conscientions pieoe of work,
and Ι am particularly pleased with the frequent and happy quotations, in
the notes, of passages from English poefs.

Walter A. Edwards, Princpal, Higlr School, Rockford, Ill: 1 arn delighted
with it. The editor has made an excellent schoolbook, without thrusting
into the background the literary charrn of tho text he is annotating. The
abundant quotations from the English poets must materially help toward
a right appreciation and enjoyment of Ovid’s poetry.

L. c.11n11,Lawrenceville Schuol‚ N J.: Professor Kelsey has again shown
how admirably he can meet the wants of good teachers, But his edition
of Ovid does more than this. lt must quicken the poetic sense of even
the most prosaic teachers. l cannot help feeling that many a pupil will
thank Professor Kelsey ior having shown how the same themes that in·
spired Ovid still live in onr own English classics. We have had given to
us a manual of mythology, a scholarly edition of a Latin classic, and an
abundance of poetic inspiration, all at once. Ovid did not write to ex·
hibit the grammatica] usages of his day, or to help make philologists; and
Professor Kelsey has not made the mistake of supposing that his verses
are best used when they are made to serve such purposes

Professor George 11. white, Oberlin College: The notes are made attrac-
tive, and their meaning inore clear, by many quotations frorn a wide range

of English poets. ln this latter respect it is superior to every other school -

edition of the ancient classice. l commend the book without reserve.
